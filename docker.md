## Basic Terminologies

1- Docker Image — In very simple terms docker image is just like an ISO image file used to install any OS. You can view all docker images(publicly available on DockerHub)

2- Docker Container — When a Docker Image runs it becomes a Docker Container. You can run the same image again and a different docker container will be created.

3- Dockerfile — A Dockerfile contains all the code to set up a docker container from downloading the docker image to setting the environment.
